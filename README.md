KnuckV4NHull is a low profile case for V4N4G0N-compatible PCBs.

It is a mix derivative from Knuckhull and Hullagon. While Knuckhull and Hullagon have metal construction, current version of KnuckV4NHull is designed for 3D printing only and not tested for CNC or any other metal construction.

KnuckV4NHull uses V4N4G0N's Hull-style plate.
