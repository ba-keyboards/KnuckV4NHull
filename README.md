Vandal (previously codenamed KnuckV4NHull) is a low profile case for V4N4G0N-compatible PCBs.

It is a mixed derivative from Knuckhull and V4N4G0N R3 case aka. Hullagon. While both of those cases have metal construction, current version of Vandal is designed with 3D printing specifications and not tested for CNC or any other metal construction.

Vandal uses [V4N4G0N's Hull-style plate (R3)](https://trashman.wiki/en/files#v4n4g0n).
